= Introduction =
In the world of software management there exists a dread place called "dependency hell." The bigger your system grows and the more packages you integrate into your software, the more likely you are to find yourself, one day, in this pit of despair. -- Excerpt from www.semver.org



= Details =

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

  * MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  * MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
  * PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
